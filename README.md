# Currency Converter & Visualization
Converts currencies and represents rates over certain periods as graphs.
This projects connects with a local database where all the values are stored in tables. 
Then the data is extracted in queries to java classes and used to build graphs. There's also an option to save the graphs as PNG.
The project consists of a simple GUI where the user can enter any given amount and convert it (on the first panel), 
and build graphs consisting of rates between 2 currencies on the second panel.
